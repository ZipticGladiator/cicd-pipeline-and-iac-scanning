# CI/CD Pipeline and IaC Scanning

## Project Overview

This project implements an automated vulnerability scan for both the CI/CD pipeline and any misconfigurations in our Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployments. By leveraging Terraform for AWS environment configuration and GitHub Actions for automation, we've created a robust, secure, and efficient workflow.

## Key Features

- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Ensures our pipeline and IaC deployments are free from vulnerabilities.
- **Terraform for AWS**: Configures our AWS environment using Infrastructure as Code.
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Automates the deployment process, making it seamless and efficient.
- **IaC Security Scanning with Trivy**: Screens IaC code for misconfigurations, alerting engineers to any security vulnerabilities with detailed severity information.

## Benefits

- **Independent Code Deployment**: Engineers can push safe code independently, reducing bottlenecks and increasing productivity.
- **Shift-Left Security**: Detects and addresses vulnerabilities early in the development cycle, before they reach production.

## Conclusion

By automating resource deployment and security scanning, we've created a streamlined and secure process that empowers engineers to deliver high-quality code with confidence.
